Stuff from and for my OS X home directory. Do with this whatever you want.
Simply source hmansify.sh from ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile or similar.
Remember, this stuff is intended for use on an OS X system, and will
probably not work for you. :)

Stuff hmansify.sh does:

* enable bash completion if installed (well, on OS X)
* default 'ls' output to coloured
* change a couple of environment variables I need for Rails development

It also adds a couple of useful new binaries:

* 'mategem gem_name': opens Textmate with the source of the specified gem. Requires
  current directory to contain a bundler Gemfile.
* 'git wtf', 'git rank-contributors' and 'git show-merges', all taken from
  William's miscellaneous git tools <http://git-wt-commit.rubyforge.org/>
* 'markdown', from <http://pragmatig.com/2009/06/17/quick-markdown-preview-for-github-readme/>
